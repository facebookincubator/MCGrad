# Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning for calibration methods.

:::info Python API Documentation
For detailed documentation, refer to the source code:

```python
from mcgrad import tuning
help(tuning)
```
:::

## Overview

The tuning module provides tools for optimizing hyperparameters of calibration methods using techniques like Bayesian optimization.

See the [source code](https://github.com/facebookincubator/MCGrad/blob/main/src/mcgrad/tuning.py) for implementation details.
