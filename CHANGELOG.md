# Changelog

All notable changes to MCGrad will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Fixed documentation inaccuracies in the MCE metrics page: corrected `mce` formatting from percent to absolute scale, added documentation for MDE and all four available scales, and clarified statistical interpretation of sigma threshold and p-value.

### Changed
- Improved early stopping performance by caching per-fold metric DataFrames and fold splits, avoiding redundant DataFrame reconstruction on every round × fold × metric evaluation (#229)
- Speed up fitting with early stopping and save training performance enabled: Remove redundant `_predict` call on the training set in `_determine_best_num_rounds`, reusing predictions already returned by `_fit_single_round` instead (#236)
- Skip redundant `_inverse_transform_predictions` calls in `_predict` when `return_all_rounds=False`. Previously called the logistic function on every boosting round but only used the last result; now calls it once. Reduces total inverse-transform calls during early stopping from O(R²) to O(R) (#241)
- Unified `logistic()` and `logistic_vectorized()` into a single `logistic()` function that handles both scalar and array inputs. The `logistic_vectorized` alias has been removed. Performance improvement of ~16x on large arrays by using native NumPy operations instead of `np.vectorize`.
- Vectorized `segments_ecce_pvalue` computation in `MulticalibrationError` using NumPy broadcasting instead of `np.vectorize`. Unified `_ecce_cdf` and `ecce_pvalue_from_sigma` to accept both scalar and array inputs, removing the separate `_ecce_pvalue_from_sigma_vectorized` helper.
- Eliminated redundant `segments * sample_weight` broadcast in `_calculate_cumulative_differences` (~6% faster on the ECCE computation hot path).
- Eliminated redundant `segments * sample_weight` broadcast in `_ecce_standard_deviation_per_segment` (~30% faster on the std dev computation hot path).
- Replaced per-segment `pd.DataFrame` creation with batch list accumulation in `get_segment_masks`, yielding 2.2-3.1x speedup on the segment generation hot path (~53% of total pipeline time).

### Added
- Conda / Mamba installation instructions to the documentation (#234)
- `youdens_j` metric (Youden's J statistic / informedness) in the `metrics` module. Computes the continuous net detection rate as `E[scores | positive] - E[scores | negative]`, ranging from -1 to 1, with support for sample weights (#233)
- Support for float calibration targets (soft labels) in `MCGrad`. Labels can now be continuous values in [0, 1] instead of only binary 0/1 or True/False. This enables calibrating to confidence-weighted labels that account for label uncertainty and quality.
- `soft_label_log_loss` function in the `metrics` module for soft-label cross-entropy, used as the default early stopping metric in `MCGrad`.
- Feature consistency check in `predict()` that validates feature names and order match those used during `fit()`. Previously, mismatched features produced confusing encoder errors or silently wrong predictions when feature order was swapped.
- Feature names are now included in the serialized model JSON for consistency validation after deserialization
- Regression support in `MulticalibrationError` — new `outcome_type="regression"` parameter uses successive-differences variance estimation (equation 6, appendix C from the [MCE paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11251)) instead of Bernoulli variance (#218)
- Regression support in `tune_mcgrad_params` — now accepts `RegressionMCGrad` models, uses the model's `early_stopping_score_func` instead of hardcoded `normalized_entropy` (#213)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- Lowered psutil dependency to 5.9.0 to fix compatibility with Google Colab (#210)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- Fixed optimization direction in `tune_mcgrad_params` — was incorrectly maximizing normalized entropy instead of minimizing it (#202)

### Added
- `use_model_predictions` parameter to `tune_mcgrad_params` to control whether the surrogate model's predicted best or the actual best observed trial is
  returned (#196)
- `mcgrad.tutorials` submodule with shared tutorial helpers (data loading,
  plotting, logging utilities)

### Changed
- Moved `folktables` from optional `[tutorials]` dependency to core dependencies


## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-30

Note: Early pre-release versions (i.e., 0.0.0 and 0.1.0) were yanked due to packaging/versioning cleanup; 0.1.1 is the first stable public release.
